## How It Works

EasyRealEstate leverages a multi-agent AI system to provide advanced analysis and decision-making tools tailored for the real estate market in Italy. The application incorporates several specialized AI agents, including a planner, a finance agent, and a user proxy. These agents interact dynamically within a constructed group chat environment to process user inputs, manage tasks, and retrieve relevant content.

1. **User Interaction**: The user starts by entering their criteria or questions regarding real estate investments in Italy. This input initiates the group chat.

2. **Task Processing**: Each of the AI agents has a specific role:
   - **Planner**: Orchestrates the workflow and ensures that tasks are assigned appropriately among agents.
   - **Finance Agent**: Handles all financial modeling aspects, analyzing potential returns and financial metrics.
   - **User Proxy**: Acts as the mediator between the user and the technical processes, presenting information in an understandable manner.

3. **Data Retrieval and Analysis**: Agents use OpenBB and Chroma for real-time data extraction and analysis. They access various datasets like the Italian Villa Dataset to pull current market data, trends, and forecasts.

4. **Group Chat Dynamics**: Through the group chat system, agents discuss and analyze the user‚Äôs query, each contributing from their expertise. The system handles natural language inputs and integrates responses into a cohesive reply.

5. **Output Generation**: The final output includes a comprehensive analysis of potential investment opportunities aligned with the user's preferences and objectives.

## Installation

**üåüSTAR and üç¥FORK this Repository, then follow the instructions below exactly.**

> please note that EasyRealEstate `runs ai models locally` , the first time you install it and run it , it can take much over an hour to start up based on your computing power!

>> however subsequent deployments will take much less time !

### Run Docker

- install and run `Docker` if it's not already there on startup by [following these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

- add your user to the `Docker` user group by running this command :
  - on Windows : 
    - `net localgroup docker-users "your-user-id" /ADD`
      your-user-id is your local Windows user name. You can determine this by looking at the folder name under C:\Users\ .
  - on Linux : 
    - [follow these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)

### Installation Instructions

**üåüSTAR and üç¥FORK this Repository, then follow the instructions below exactly.**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone the repository to a local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Josephrp/EasyRealEstate
   cd EasyRealEstate
   ```

2. **Set your OpenAI API Key**

    currently we're providing two ways to plug in your llm:

    **Using Open AI :**
        - edit the `./src/config/config.py` file using a text editor and replace your api_key_here with your api key (keep the quotes!)

    ```python
    llm_config = {"model": "gpt-4o", 
                  "api_key": "your_api_key_here", 
                  "max_tokens": 4000 , # change this according to your needs
                  "temperature": 0.7, #change this according to your needs
        }
    ```

    **Using Azure:**
        - edit the `./src/OAI_CONFIG_LIST.json.example` file using a text editor and save it as `OAI_CONFIG_LIST.json` (without the `.example`at the end !)

    ```python
    llm_config =     {
            "model": "your_deployment_name_here", # mine is "tonicgpt"
            "api_key": "your_api_key_here",
            "base_url": "your_endpoint_url_here", # https://eastus2.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/
            "api_type": "azure",
            "api_version": "your_api_version_here", # eg "2024-02-01" for gpt-4o
            "max_tokens": 1800 ,# change this according to your needs
            "temperature": 0.7, #change this according to your needs
      }
    ```

    **In both cases:**
        - make sure you ["comment out"](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/python-block-comment) the method you are **not** using in `./src/config/config.py` !

3. **Set Your OpenBB Key Here**

    - then edit the `./src/config/.env.example` file using a text editor and replace your api_key_here with your api key also !

    - Get your openbb PAT from https://my.openbb.co/app/platform/pat and also add it to the `.env.example` file

    - save the `.env.example` file as `.env`in the same folder

4. **Install**

    in the command line :

    ```sh
    poetry install
    ```

5. **Run Chroma**

    - Open a new terminal and run this command to start chroma :

     ```sh
      chroma run --path ./src/memory/chromadb
      ```

6. **Run EasyRealEstate**

    in your virtual environment activated terminal from step #2 :

    ```sh
    poetry run python main.py
    ```

### Additional Configuration (Optional)

To improve results you may want to increase the number of `conversation turns` the group chat takes. Simply edit `main.py`using an editor and increase the number here :

```python
    groupchat = autogen.GroupChat(
      ...
        max_round=12, # <-- change this number !
      ...
```
