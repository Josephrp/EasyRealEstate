## How It Works

EasyRealEstate leverages a multi-agent AI system to provide advanced analysis and decision-making tools tailored for the real estate market in Italy. The application incorporates several specialized AI agents, including a planner, a finance agent, and a user proxy. These agents interact dynamically within a constructed group chat environment to process user inputs, manage tasks, and retrieve relevant content.

1. **User Interaction**: The user starts by entering their criteria or questions regarding real estate investments in Italy. This input initiates the group chat.
   
2. **Task Processing**: Each of the AI agents has a specific role:
   - **Planner**: Orchestrates the workflow and ensures that tasks are assigned appropriately among agents.
   - **Finance Agent**: Handles all financial modeling aspects, analyzing potential returns and financial metrics.
   - **User Proxy**: Acts as the mediator between the user and the technical processes, presenting information in an understandable manner.

3. **Data Retrieval and Analysis**: Agents use OpenBB and Chroma for real-time data extraction and analysis. They access various datasets like the Italian Villa Dataset to pull current market data, trends, and forecasts.

4. **Group Chat Dynamics**: Through the group chat system, agents discuss and analyze the user‚Äôs query, each contributing from their expertise. The system handles natural language inputs and integrates responses into a cohesive reply.

5. **Output Generation**: The final output includes a comprehensive analysis of potential investment opportunities aligned with the user's preferences and objectives.
